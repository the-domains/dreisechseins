            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Light's L16 Pocket-Sized Multi-Aperture Camera</h1><p>No other camera looks quite like the newly announced Light L16, with one side featuring a whopping 16 lenses. This visual assessment immediately reveals just how advanced the technology is within the device. When capturing an image, all lenses fire at different focal lengths and a computational software within the camera assembles them to maximize every pixel.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3a15091274eec7069ecc73315c0d0bf176c8c5ea.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>eero: No More Internet Dead Zones</h1><p>Nearly all homes have a WiFi dead zone: you never get messages in the kitchen, you can't watch Netflix in the bedroom, you can't FaceTime in the backyard. This is simply because most of us have one WiFi router for our entire home, and that just doesn't work for how we use Internet today.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e75956575966b1c70c11ff614cb972cd2133a6a9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Sevenhugs' Smart Remote</h1><p>Looking to simplify the endless number of apps and interfaces used to control smart-home products, French start-up Sevenhugs has introduced the first "contextually aware" universal Smart Remote. In other words, it's the first remote to understand where it is in your home and what it's pointing at, allowing users to simply point and click to control devices instead of switching between apps.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/df1caa77bd36920224edf22d445e863c5b829e80.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Ars VR headset showdown-Oculus Rift vs. HTC Vive</h1><p>In our original reviews of the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive, we tried very hard to examine these virtual reality systems on their own merits without constant comparisons to the competition. But no product exists in a vacuum. After years of buildup, we're now faced with two competitive, PC-tethered VR headsets hitting the market right next to each other.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a473611978ca4931a0d74678d9cd4a6eaafdb8a9.jpg"></article>]]></description>
